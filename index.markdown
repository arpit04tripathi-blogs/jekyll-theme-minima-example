This is the index page.

To modify this make changes to `index.md` file.

Or to use default index page by theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#contents-at-a-glance){:target='_blank'}, change the layout from `page` to `home` in `index.md`

List of **post** based on layout home can be seen [here](posts)
